# CNN
A convolutional neural network classifying images in the cifar-10 dataset

This network was made with inspiration from this article: https://medium.com/data-bistrot/a-simple-image-classifier-with-a-python-neural-network-82a5522fe48b

List of changes:
- Modularized code
- Added a third convolutional layer to the model
- Reduced kernel size and added padding
- Added more evaluation metrics
- Increased training epochs

My goal with this small project was to learn more about CNN:s.
